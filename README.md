# Word Count tech test

This tech test was something I saw a while ago. It is used for pair programming tech test, more to see what your abilities were as a team, not as a solo developer. However this tech test was addictively fun so I wanted to build something based on the criteria and have a nice solution to work to.

``` 
GIVEN a body of text
WHEN that text is analysed
THEN return back the information required
```

This is quite vague, but the tech test is the following. Given a block of text, extract the following out information out of that given block of text:

- Number of words
- Number of sentences
- Length of the longest word
- The six most occuring words
- Percentage of words occurring once


There will be more added to the criteria but this will be a good start for now.



## Assumptions

The body of text will come from somewhere, not clear where - but i'll try it with both sentence or text file
